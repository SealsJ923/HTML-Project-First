                <p class="fish-text"> <!-- Paragraph about Tarpon location -->
                    Tarpon (Megalops atlanticus) are highly migratory fish that thrive in warm coastal waters,
                    estuaries, bays, and river mouths, favoring shallow flats, deep channels, and mangrove-lined
                    shorelines. Some of the best locations to find tarpon include Florida's Boca Grande Pass, the
                    Everglades, Key West, and Tampa Bay, as well as the Gulf of Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, South
                    Carolina, and Georgia. International hotspots include Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula, Costa Rica,
                    Belize,
                    Puerto Rico, and West Africa (Gabon and Angola), where some of the world's largest tarpon are
                    caught. The best time to target tarpon is between April and October,
                    especially during early morning and late evening, when they are most active. By targeting the right
                    locations, monitoring tides, and recognizing key signs of tarpon presence, anglers can significantly
                    improve their chances of hooking into one of the most thrilling sport fish in the world.

                <p class="fish-text"> <!-- Paragraph about Largemouth Bass location -->
                    Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides) are highly adaptable freshwater predators that thrive in
                    lakes, ponds, rivers, reservoirs, and backwater areas across North America. They prefer warm, calm
                    waters with plenty of cover, such as submerged vegetation, fallen trees, docks, lily pads, and rock
                    structures, where they ambush prey. Anglers should look for schools of baitfish, surface
                    disturbances, and jumping fish, as these
                    indicate active bass feeding zones. Using fish finders and sonar technology can help pinpoint bass
                    suspended in deeper water. By understanding seasonal movements and targeting key structures,
                    anglers can consistently locate and catch largemouth bass throughout the year.

                <p class="fish-text"> <!-- Paragraph about Red Drum location -->
                    Red Drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), commonly known as Redfish, prefer shallow waters (1-4 feet) with
                    access to deeper channels. The best time to locate red drum is during spring and fall, especially
                    during high tide or moving tides,
                    when baitfish and crabs are flushed into feeding areas. Early morning and late evening are prime
                    times, as redfish are more active and less pressured by anglers. Popular techniques include sight
                    fishing on the flats, where anglers look for tailing redfish,
                    bottom fishing with cut bait near structures, and working artificial lures along grass lines and
                    oyster beds. When hooked, red drum are known for their hard-hitting strikes and long runs, making
                    them a favorite among inshore anglers. Many states have slot size limits (usually 18-27 inches) to
                    protect breeding
                    populations, so practicing catch-and-release for larger bull redfish helps sustain the species.
