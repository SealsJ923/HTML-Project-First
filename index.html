                <p class="fish-description">
                    Tarpon (<em>Megalops atlanticus</em>) are prized sport fish known
                    for their strength, size, and acrobatic jumps. Found in warm coastal
                    waters and estuaries, top fishing spots include Florida, the Gulf of
                    Mexico, Central America, and West Africa. The best time to fish for
                    tarpon is from April to October, especially at dawn or dusk and
                    during incoming tides. Anglers use heavy tackle with live bait or
                    lures, employing techniques like drift fishing, sight casting, and
                    fly fishing. When hooked, tarpon often leap—requiring anglers to
                    <strong>“Bow to the King”</strong> by lowering the rod to avoid
                    breaking the line. As a protected species, they should be handled
                    carefully and released properly.

                <p class="fish-description">
                    Largemouth Bass (<em>Micropterus salmoides</em>) are popular
                    freshwater game fish found in lakes, ponds, rivers, and reservoirs,
                    especially around vegetation, structures, and drop-offs. They are
                    most active during early mornings, late evenings, and in
                    spring—especially during spawning season. Effective gear includes a
                    medium-heavy rod with a spinning or baitcasting reel and 10 to 20 lb
                    line. Both live bait (like shiners and nightcrawlers) and artificial
                    lures (such as plastic worms, crankbaits, and spinnerbaits) work
                    well. Successful techniques include Texas rigging, skipping jigs,
                    and working lures near cover. Using sonar and watching for surface
                    activity can help locate feeding bass. Catch-and-release is
                    encouraged for conservation.

                <summary class="fish-summary">Red Drum</summary>
                <p class="fish-description">
                    Red Drum (<em>Sciaenops ocellatus</em>), or Redfish, are powerful saltwater
                    game fish commonly found in shallow coastal waters, including
                    estuaries, marshes, tidal creeks, grass flats, and near beaches or
                    jetties. They prefer 1 - 4 feet of water with access to deeper
                    channels. The best times to catch red drum are during spring and
                    fall, especially on high or moving tides, and around dawn or dusk
                    when they are most active. Productive techniques include sight
                    fishing for tailing redfish on the flats, bottom fishing with cut
                    bait near structures, and casting artificial lures along grass lines
                    and oyster beds. Known for their aggressive strikes and long runs,
                    red drum offer an exciting challenge. Many states enforce slot size
                    limits (typically 18 - 27 inches) to protect breeding fish, so
                    catch-and-release is encouraged for larger bull redfish to support
                    population health.
