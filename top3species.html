                <p class="fish-text"> <!-- Paragraph about Tarpon -->
                    The Tarpon (<em>Megalops atlanticus</em>) is a large, powerful fish known for
                    its spectacular aerial displays and immense strength, making it a
                    favorite among anglers. Often called the "Silver King" due to its
                    shimmering, silver-colored scales, tarpon can grow over 8 feet long
                    and weigh more than 280 pounds. They are found in warm coastal
                    waters, estuaries, lagoons, and even freshwater rivers, primarily in
                    the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea. Tarpon
                    are highly migratory and prefer shallow waters with access to deeper
                    channels. One unique feature of tarpon is their ability to gulp air
                    from the surface, allowing them to survive in low-oxygen
                    environments. Despite their size, tarpon primarily feed on smaller
                    fish, shrimp, and crabs, using their large, upturned mouths to
                    suction prey. While highly prized in sport fishing for their
                    endurance and acrobatics, they are rarely eaten due to their bony
                    structure, leading to a strong catch-and-release culture among
                    anglers.

                <p class="fish-text"> <!-- Paragraph about Largemouth Bass -->
                    The Largemouth Bass (<em>Micropterus salmoides</em>) is one of the most
                    popular freshwater game fish in North America, known for its
                    aggressive strikes and thrilling fights. Recognized by its dark
                    green body with a horizontal black stripe running along its sides,
                    this species can grow over 2 feet long and weigh more than 20
                    pounds. Largemouth bass thrive in lakes, rivers, ponds, and
                    reservoirs, preferring shallow, vegetated areas where they can
                    ambush prey. These opportunistic predators feed on smaller fish,
                    insects, frogs, and even small birds or rodents when given the
                    chance. They are most active in warmer waters and are known for
                    their explosive topwater strikes, making them a favorite among
                    anglers. Catching a largemouth bass often requires using soft
                    plastic lures, crankbaits, or topwater frogs, depending on water
                    conditions. Conservation efforts, including catch-and-release
                    practices, help maintain healthy bass populations for future
                    generations of anglers.

                <p class="fish-text"> <!-- Paragraph about Red Drum -->
                    The Red Drum (<em>Sciaenops ocellatus</em>), commonly known as Redfish, is a
                    highly sought-after saltwater game fish prized for its powerful runs
                    and delicious flavor. Identified by its bronze-to-reddish body and
                    distinctive black spot near the tail, this species can grow over 4
                    feet long and weigh more than 90 pounds, though most catches are
                    between 10-30 pounds. Red Drum thrive in estuaries, coastal bays,
                    and shallow flats, often feeding near oyster beds and grassy
                    shorelines. These fish are opportunistic predators, feeding on
                    shrimp, crabs, and small baitfish. Redfish are commonly caught using
                    live bait like mullet and shrimp or artificial lures like soft
                    plastics and spoons. They are most active in warmer months, with
                    larger "bull reds" migrating offshore to spawn in the fall. Many
                    anglers practice catch-and-release to help sustain populations, as
                    Red Drum are a protected species in certain areas.
