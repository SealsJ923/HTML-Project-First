                <p class="fish-text"> <!-- Paragraph about catching Tarpon -->
                    Catching a Tarpon (<em>Megalops atlanticus</em>) is an exhilarating experience due to their size, strength,
                    and acrobatic jumps. Found in warm coastal waters, estuaries,
                    and deep channels, top locations to catch tarpon include Florida (Key West, Boca Grande, Tampa Bay),
                    the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean, and parts of Central and South America.
                    The best time to fish for tarpon is April through October, especially during dawn and dusk when they
                    are most active. An incoming tide is ideal, as it pushes baitfish into shallows,
                    attracting feeding tarpon. For tackle, anglers should use a 7-8 ft medium-heavy spinning or
                    baitcasting rod, paired with a 5000-8000 size reel, 50-80 lb braided mainline, and a 60-100 lb
                    fluorocarbon leader to handle their powerful
                    runs and bony mouths. Live bait such as crabs, mullet, pilchards, and threadfin herring are highly
                    effective, while artificial lures like soft plastic swimbaits, DOA Baitbusters, and topwater plugs
                    also work well. Drift fishing near
                    inlets and bridges, sight fishing for rolling tarpon, and chumming with cut bait are proven
                    techniques, while fly fishing requires heavy tackle and streamer patterns. When hooked, tarpon often
                    jump, so anglers must "Bow to the King" by
                    lowering their rod to prevent the line from snapping. As a protected species, tarpon should be
                    handled carefully&mdash;using dehooking tools, keeping them in the water, and reviving them before
                    release. With fights lasting 30-60 minutes,
                    catching a tarpon is both a test of skill and endurance, making it one of the most rewarding
                    experiences in sport fishing.

                <p class="fish-text"> <!-- Paragraph about catching Largemouth Bass -->
                    Catching a Largemouth Bass (<em>Micropterus salmoides</em>) requires the right combination of location,
                    timing, tackle, bait, and technique to successfully land one of the most popular freshwater game
                    fish. Largemouth bass are commonly found in lakes,
                    ponds, rivers, and reservoirs, especially near vegetation, submerged structures, and drop-offs,
                    where they ambush prey. The best time to catch them is during early morning and late evening, as
                    bass are more active in cooler temperatures.
                    Spring (March-May) is the prime season, particularly during spawning, when bass move into shallow
                    waters. The best tackle setup includes a 6.5-7.5 ft medium-heavy spinning or baitcasting rod, paired
                    with a 2000-3000 size spinning reel or a
                    baitcaster, using a 10-20 lb braided or fluorocarbon line for better sensitivity and durability.
                    Live bait such as shiners, nightcrawlers, and minnows work well, but artificial lures are the most
                    popular choice. Top-performing lures include
                    soft plastic worms, crankbaits, spinnerbaits, jigs, and topwater frogs, each effective depending on
                    water conditions and bass behavior. Techniques like Texas rigging a soft plastic worm, slowly
                    retrieving crankbaits along drop-offs, and
                    skipping jigs under docks are highly effective. Practicing catch-and-release helps maintain healthy
                    bass populations for future generations, making largemouth bass fishing both an exciting and
                    rewarding sport.

                <p class="fish-text"> <!-- Paragraph about catching Red Drum -->
                    Catching a Red Drum (<em>Sciaenops ocellatus</em>), commonly known as Redfish, requires understanding their
                    habitat, feeding behavior, and seasonal patterns. These powerful saltwater game fish are found in
                    coastal estuaries,
                    marshes, tidal creeks, grass flats, and along beaches and jetties, preferring shallow waters (1-4
                    feet) with access to deeper channels. The best time to catch red drum is during spring and fall,
                    especially during high
                    tide or moving tides, when baitfish and crabs are flushed into feeding areas. Many states have slot
                    size limits (usually 18-27 inches) to protect breeding populations, so practicing catch-and-release
                    for larger bull redfish
                    helps sustain the species.
